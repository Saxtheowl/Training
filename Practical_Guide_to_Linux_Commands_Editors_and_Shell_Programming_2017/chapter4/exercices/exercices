1. Is each of the following an absolute pathname, a relative pathname, or a
simple filename?
a. milk_coExercises 121
b. correspond/business/milk_co
c. /home/max
d. /home/max/literature/promo
e. ..
f. letter.0210
2. List the commands you can use to perform these operations:
a. Make your home directory the working directory
b. Identify the working directory
3. If the working directory is /home/max with a subdirectory named
literature, give three sets of commands you can use to create a subdirectory
named classics under literature. Also give several sets of commands you can
use to remove the classics directory and its contents.
4. The df utility displays all mounted filesystems along with information about
each. Use the df utility with the –h (human-readable) option to answer the
following questions.
a. How many filesystems are mounted on the local system?
b. Which filesystem stores your home directory?
c. Assuming your answer to exercise 4a is two or more, attempt to create a
hard link to a file on another filesystem. What error message is displayed?
What happens when you attempt to create a symbolic link to the file
instead?
5. Suppose you have a file that is linked to a file owned by another user. How
can you ensure that changes to the file are no longer shared?
6. You should have read permission for the /etc/passwd file. To answer the fol-
lowing questions, use cat or less to display /etc/passwd. Look at the fields
of information in /etc/passwd for the users on the local system.
a. Which character is used to separate fields in /etc/passwd?
b. How many fields are used to describe each user?
c. How many users are on the local system?
d. How many different login shells are in use on your system? (Hint: Look
at the last field.)
e. The second field of /etc/passwd stores user passwords in encoded form.
If the password field contains an x, your system uses shadow passwords
and stores the encoded passwords elsewhere. Does your system use
shadow passwords?122 Chapter 4 The Filesystem
7. If /home/zach/draft and /home/max/letter are links to the same file and the
following sequence of events occurs, what will be the date in the opening of
the letter?
a. Max gives the command vim letter.
b. Zach gives the command vim draft.
c. Zach changes the date in the opening of the letter to January 31, writes
the file, and exits from vim .
d. Max changes the date to February 1, writes the file, and exits from vim .
8. Suppose a user belongs to a group that has all permissions on a file named
jobs_list, but the user, as the owner of the file, has no permissions. Describe
which operations, if any, the user/owner can perform on jobs_list. Which
command can the user/owner give that will grant the user/owner all permis-
sions on the file?
9. Does the root directory have any subdirectories you cannot search as an
ordinary user? Does the root directory have any subdirectories you cannot
read as a regular user? Explain.
10. Assume you are given the directory structure show	n in Figure 4-2 on
page 83 and the following directory permissions:
d--x--x---
drwxr-xr-x
3 zach pubs 512 2013-03-10 15:16 business
2 zach pubs 512 2013-03-10 15:16 business/milk_co
For each category of permissions—owner, group, and other—what happens
when you run each of the following commands? Assume the working direc-
tory is the parent of correspond and that the file cheese_co is readable by
everyone.
a. cd correspond/business/milk_co
b. ls –l correspond/business
c. cat correspond/business/cheese_co

1. a. simple filename
b. relative pathname
c. absolute pathname
d. absolute pathname
e. relative pathname
f. simple filename

2.

a. cd ~
b. pwd

3. cd litterature ; mkdir classic
rm -rf classic

4.
a. 8
b. /dev/sda6
c. ln: failed to create hard link 'file_d' => '/dev/dvd': Invalid cross-device link
if I point to the file only instead with symbolic link it work

5. chmod 770 file
or chown file

6.
a. :
b. 6
c. 1
d. ?
e. yes

7. February 1

8. chmod 777 file

9. no because searching cant damage critical files on the operating system so it is tolerable, but it is not possible to read any subdirectories because some contain critical information

10.

a. root is granted
   group is granted
   other denied

b. root is denied
   group is denied
   other is denied

c. root is granted
   group is granted
   other is denied
