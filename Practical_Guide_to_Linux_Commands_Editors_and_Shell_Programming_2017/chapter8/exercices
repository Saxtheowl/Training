1. Explain the following unexpected result:
$ whereis date
date: /bin/date ...
$ echo $PATH
.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

2. What are two ways you can execute a shell script when you do not have execute
permission for the file containing the script? Can you execute a shell script if
you do not have read permission for the file containing the script?
3. What is the purpose of the PATH variable?
a. Set the PATH variable and place it in the environment so it causes the
shell to search the following directories in order:
• /usr/local/bin
• /usr/bin
• /bin
• /usr/kerberos/bin
• The bin directory in your home directory
• The working directory
b. If there is an executable file named doit in /usr/bin and another file with
the same name in your ~/bin directory, which one will be executed?
c. If your PATH variable is not set to search the working directory, how can
you execute a program located there?
d. Which command can you use to add the directory /usr/games to the end
of the list of directories in PATH?
4. Assume you have made the following assignment:
$ person=zachExercises 377
Give the output of each of the following commands.
a. echo $person
b. echo '$person'
c. echo "$person"
5. The following shell script adds entries to a file named journal-file in your
home directory. This script helps you keep track of phone conversations and
meetings.
$ cat journal
# journal: add journal entries to the file
# $HOME/journal-file
file=$HOME/journal-file
date >> $file
echo -n "Enter name of person or group: "
read name
echo "$name" >> $file
echo >> $file
cat >> $file
echo "----------------------------------------------------" >>
$file
echo >> $file
a. What do you have to do to the script to be able to execute it?
b. Why does the script use the read builtin the first time it accepts input from
the terminal and the cat utility the second time?
6. Assume the /home/zach/grants/biblios and /home/zach/biblios directories
exist. Specify Zach’s working directory after he executes each sequence of
commands. Explain what happens in each case.
a. $ pwd
/home/zach/grants
$ CDPATH=$(pwd)
$ cd
$ cd biblios
b. $ pwd
/home/zach/grants
$ CDPATH=$(pwd)
$ cd $HOME/biblios
7. Name two ways you can identify the PID number of the login shell.
8. Enter the following command:
$ sleep 30 | cat /etc/services
Is there any output from sleep ? Where does cat get its input from? What has
to happen before the shell will display a prompt?

1. This want to print time and day (doesnt work on buntu)
2. with .scriptfile 
you must have read permission in order to execute a script file
3. the path variable store all the path that store utilities binary file
a. PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/kerberos/bin:~/bin:~
b. The one which is first in the path directory, so /usr/bin
c. we can execute it with .
d. PATH+=:/usr/games
4. (none work on my system because assigning a space in a variable is not accepted) but
a. zachExercises 377
b. person
c. zachExercises 377

5. a. sh name of the script or . name of the script
b. the first one to get a fixed input and put it into a variable the second to get an infinite input to put directly in the file
6. a. /home/zach/grants/biblios
b. /home/zach/grants/biblios

7. ps -f | grep bash
pstree -p | grep bash

8. no but the command after pipe is executed because it is first in order, cat get input from the file /etc/services, 30 seconds is needed before the next prompt because of the sleep 30
