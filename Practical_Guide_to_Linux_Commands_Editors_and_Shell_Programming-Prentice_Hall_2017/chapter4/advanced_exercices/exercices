11. What is an inode? What happens to the inode when you move a file within
a filesystem?
12. What does the .. entry in a directory point to? What does this entry point
to in the root (/) directory?
13. How can you create a file named –i? Which techniques do not work, and
why do they not work? How can you remove the file named –i?Advanced Exercises
14. Suppose the working directory contains a single file named andor. What
error message is displayed when you run the following command line?
$ mv andor and\/or
Under what circumstances is it possible to run the command without pro-
ducing an error?
15. The ls –i command displays a filename preceded by the inode number of the
file (page 112). Write a command to output inode/filename pairs for the
files in the working directory, sorted by inode number. (Hint: Use a
pipeline.)
16. Do you think the system administrator has access to a program that can
decode user passwords? Why or why not? (See exercise 6.)
17. Is it possible to distinguish a file from a hard link to a file? That is, given a
filename, can you tell whether it was created using an ln command?
Explain.
18. Explain the error messages displayed in the following sequence of
commands:
$ ls -l
drwxrwxr-x. 2 max pubs 1024 03-02 17:57 dirtmp
$ ls dirtmp
$ rmdir dirtmp
rmdir: dirtmp: Directory not empty
$ rm dirtmp/ *
rm: No match.

11. inode is a unique number associated with a file, if you move the file its inode stay the same
12. the .. is the subdirectory of the working directory, if you try to cd the one of the / directory it will do nothing
13.
we can create the file with cp a ../advanced_exercices/-i advanced_exercice was my working directory
the classic touch -i does not work because it is interpreted as a flag by touch
we can delete it the same way with rm ../advanced_exercice/-i or by inode with find
14.
$mkdir and
$mv andor and/or
15. ls -i | sort
16. no, because they can even be viewed by people with less access than him
17. yes, because they will ahve the same inode number
18. ((not the same linux))
