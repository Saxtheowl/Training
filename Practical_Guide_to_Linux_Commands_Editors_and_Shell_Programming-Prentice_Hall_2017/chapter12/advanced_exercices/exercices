9. Define a function named cents that returns its argument divided by 100 and
truncated to an integer. For example:
>>> cents(12345)
123
10. Define a function named cents2 that returns its argument divided by 100
exactly (and includes decimal places if necessary). Make sure your function
does not truncate the answer. For example:
>>> cents2(12345)
123.45
11. Create a list that has four elements. Make a copy of the list and change one
of the elements in the copy. Show that the same element in the original list
did not change.Advanced Exercises

12. Why does the following assignment statement generate an error?
>>> x.y = 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
13. Call map() with two arguments:
1. A Lambda function that returns the square of the number it was called
with
2. A list holding the even numbers between 4 and 15; generate the list inline
using range()
14. Use a list comprehension to display the numbers from 1 through 30 inclusive
that are divisible by 3.
15. Write a function that takes an integer, val, as an argument. The function
asks the user to enter a number. If the number is greater than val, the
function displays Too high. and returns 1; if the number is less than val,
the function displays Too low. and returns â€“1; if the number equals val,
the function displays Got it! and returns 0. Call the function repeatedly
until the user enters the right number.
16. Rewrite exercise 15 to call the function with a random number between 0
and 10 inclusive. (Hint: The randint function in the random library returns
a random number between its two arguments inclusive.)
17. Write a function that counts the characters in a string the user inputs. Then
write a routine that calls the function and displays the following output.
$ ./count_letters.py
Enter some words: The rain in Spain
The string "The rain in Spain" has 17 characters in it.
18. Write a function that counts the vowels (aeiou) in a string the user inputs.
Make sure it counts upper- and lowercase vowels. Then write a routine that
calls the function and displays the following output.
$ ./count_vowels.py
Enter some words: Go East young man!
The string "Go East young man!" has 6 vowels in it.
19. Write a function that counts all the characters and the vowels in a string
the user inputs. Then write a routine that calls the function and displays
the following output.
$ ./count_all.py
Enter some words: The sun rises in the East and sets in the West.
13 letters in 47 are vowels.
