1. What is meant by implied display? Is it available in the Python interactive
shell or from a program file? Provide a simple example of implied display.
2. Write and run a Python program that you store in a file. The program
should demonstrate how to prompt the user for input and display the string
the user entered.
3. Using the Python interactive shell, instantiate a list that holds three-letter
abbreviations for the first six months of the year and display the list.
4. Using the Python interactive shell, use a for control structure to iterate
through the elements of the list you instantiated in exercise 3 and display
each abbreviated name followed by a period on a line by itself. (Hint: The
period is a string.)
5. Using the Python interactive shell, put the elements of the list you instantiated
in exercise 3 in alphabetical order.
6. Instantiate a dictionary in which the keys are the months in the third quarter
of the year and the values are the number of days in the corresponding
month. Display the dictionary, the keys, and the values. Add the tenth
month of the year to the dictionary and display the value of that month only.
7. What does iterable mean? Name two builtin objects that are iterable. Which
control structure can you use to loop through an iterable object?
8. Write and demonstrate a Lambda function named stg() that appends .txt to
its argument. What happens when you call the function with an integer?

1. it allow a shell to output command of a programming language, it is avaible in the python interactive shell, >>> a = 5 >>> a  5
2.done
3.>>>months = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun'] >>> months
4.['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun']
>>> for i in months:
...     print months[cnt] + '.'
...     cnt += 1
5. sorted(months)
6. >>> Q3 = {'august':31, 'september':30, 'october':31} >>> Q3['november'] = 30 >>> >>> Q3['november']
7. it mean it can be parsed one by one, list and dictionnary, for
8. >>> a = lambda a: a + '.txt' >>> a('lol')
it output an error, it can be fixed by adding ' ' to the number
